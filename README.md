This is Web Scrapping web application that has been made in ReactJS and Flask. The Flask server returns a JSON format which is utilized by the ReactJS. 

The application accepts any URL in the text box. Upon submitting the URL, the application returns scrapes the URL and then displays the scrapped code in textarea. It works on any URL. 

Another function which has been only developed on the server is a function which scrapes the Instagram profile of an account based on the URL provided. It returns the basic information about that account. 

You all are free to use and contribute this piece of code anyway you like.

Cheers!
